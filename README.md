Key takeaways and learnings:

DOM Manipulation: How to dynamically create, modify, and remove DOM elements using JavaScript. How to create rows and columns of div elements, add classes to them, and append them to the container element.

Event Handling: The script utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions. It captures the mouseover event on the created pixels (columns) and adds a class to change their appearance.

Dynamic Grid Creation: By providing a number through the squareNo input, the script creates a grid with rows and columns based on that number.

CSS Class Manipulation: The script adds and removes CSS classes to control the styling of the grid and the pixels when hovering over them.

Overall, the script demonstrates the basic concepts of manipulating the DOM, handling events, validating user input, and creating dynamic grids. 
It showcases the use of JavaScript to create an interactive grid that changes appearance when interacting with the pixels.
